### Most Expensive Functions

1. **`execute`** (~90,000 CPU instructions)
    - Why: Validates approval threshold, checks timelock expiration, and executes token transfer
    - Optimization tip: Ensure all required approvals are collected before attempting execution

2. **`propose`** (~70,000 CPU instructions)
    - Why: Validates proposer eligibility and creates new proposal storage
    - Optimization tip: Batch similar proposals when possible

### Cost Estimation

Soroban charges fees based on:

- **CPU Instructions:** ~0.0001 XLM per 10,000 instructions
- **Memory:** ~0.00001 XLM per byte
- **Ledger Entries:** ~0.001 XLM per read/write

**Example:** Executing a multisig proposal costs approximately:

- CPU: 90,000 instructions × 0.0001 XLM / 10,000 = 0.0009 XLM
- Memory: 3,500 bytes × 0.00001 XLM = 0.035 XLM
- Ledger: 6 operations × 0.001 XLM = 0.006 XLM
- **Total:** ~0.042 XLM per execution

## Known Limitations

- Owner list is fixed after initialization
- **Threshold is immutable after initialization.** If a future version adds `update_threshold()`, the `approved_at` logic in `approve()` must be reviewed carefully. Lowering the threshold could cause a proposal to retroactively meet the new threshold at an earlier `approved_at` timestamp, potentially allowing premature execution. Any threshold mutation must preserve the original `approved_at` timestamp or implement additional safeguards.

## Native XLM Support

`forge-multisig` supports native XLM transfers alongside regular Soroban token transfers.

**How it works:**
On Soroban, native XLM is accessed through the Stellar Asset Contract (SAC) for the native asset. The SAC exposes the same `token::Client` interface as any other Soroban token, so execution is handled identically — the only difference is the proposal is flagged with `is_native: true` for clarity.

**Creating a native XLM proposal:**

```text
// Transfer 10 XLM (100_000_000 stroops) to a recipient
let id = client.propose_xlm(&owner, &recipient, &xlm_sac_address, &100_000_000);
```

**Approval and execution** work exactly the same as token proposals — use `approve()` and `execute()` with the returned proposal ID.

**Getting the native XLM SAC address:**

- Testnet/Mainnet: use `stellar contract id asset --asset native --network <network>`
- In tests: register a SAC with `env.register_stellar_asset_contract_v2(...)` and mint XLM into the contract with `StellarAssetClient::mint()`

**Identifying proposal type:**

```text
let proposal = client.get_proposal(&id).unwrap();
if proposal.is_native {
    // native XLM transfer
} else {
    // Soroban token transfer
}
```
